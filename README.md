I am a math grad. I am passionate about systems engineering in general. I have around 7 years of experience in the field of data. I have worked as data scientist, data engineer and now developing big data tools.

These days I am learning - Operating systems, concurrent programming, distributed systems and parallel programming. 

ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about open source and contributing to projects that make a difference. Currently, I'm actively contributing to the following repositories:

- [Datafusion-Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet): Apache DataFusion Comet Spark Accelerator. I am actively contributing to this repo right now.
- [raft-rs](https://github.com/spacewalkhq/raft-rs) (maintainer): An understandable, fast, customizable and scalable async-await Raft implementation with zero-copy.


minor contributions - 
- [Apache Iceberg-rust](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhawvipul+is%3Aclosed): Rust implementation of Apache Iceberg.
- [ParadeDB](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pulls/vaibhawvipul): Postgres for Search and Analytics written in Rust.
- [Arroyo](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/765): Distributed stream processing engine in Rust.

I also maintain a blog where I write about tech, notes on research papers I read, and other long form writing - [Check out my blog](https://vaibhawvipul.github.io/)
